### Task: Refactor Backend Session Management for WorkOS Auth

#### Changes Made:

- **Session Decoupling:** Replaced WorkOS access token as session cookie with internal UUID session ID, managed as a stable, persistent session identifier.
- **Pure CRUD Functions:**
  - Added `create_or_update_session` (generates UUID, stores WorkOS tokens, expiration, is_active).
  - Added `get_session_by_id` (fetch by internal session ID).
  - Added `update_session_tokens` (updates access/refresh tokens and expiration by internal ID).
  - Updated `invalidate_session` to support both WorkOS and internal session IDs.
- **Auth Logic:**
  - `get_session_id_from_cookie` (pure, extracts session ID from cookie).
  - `get_current_active_user` (pure, fetches session, refreshes tokens if needed, returns user).
  - Callback endpoint creates internal session and sets cookie.
  - Logout endpoint invalidates by internal session ID and clears cookie.
- **Lint Fixes:** All imports now at top of files, unused imports removed, DRY/KISS applied.
- **Functional/Immutable:** All new logic is modular, pure, and composable. No in-place mutation.

#### Next Steps:
- Test backend session and auth flow with `uv run pytest ..`.
- Integrate frontend to use new internal session cookie (`app_session_id`).
- Ensure seamless token refresh and route protection.
- Expand tests for session expiry/refresh and logout.

#### Notes:
- Follows functional programming, immutability, DRY, and KISS principles.
- All session and token management is now backend-driven and robust.

### Task: Implement API Abstraction Layer for WorkOS Integration

#### Changes Made:

5. **Profile Page Cleanup & Logout Flow**
   - Removed all legacy fields (firstName, lastName) from profile UI
   - Profile and navigation now use only MeResponse contract fields
   - Implemented logout flow: API abstraction for POST /api/auth/logout, frontend redirect to returned WorkOS logout URL

1. **API Types (`lib/api/types.ts`)**
   - Added comprehensive type definitions for API responses
   - Created `ApiResult<T>` type for better error handling
   - Added `LoginInitiationResponse` type for auth flow
   - Included `ApiError` type for standardized error responses

2. **API Client (`lib/api/client.ts`)**
   - Implemented a singleton `ApiClient` class
   - Added base URL configuration from environment variables
   - Implemented generic `request` method with error handling
   - Added `initiateLogin()` method for auth flow
   - Improved error handling with type safety
   - Added `isApiError` type guard

3. **Auth Flow Hook (`lib/hooks/useAuthFlow.ts`)**
   - Created `useAuthFlow` hook to manage authentication state
   - Handles login initiation and error states
   - Provides loading state management
   - Includes error handling and display

4. **Login Page (`app/login/page.tsx`)**
   - Updated to use new `useAuthFlow` hook
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Improved UI with feedback during auth process
   - Added auto-redirect for authenticated users

#### Next Steps:
1. Implement the backend API endpoints
2. Add session management
3. Implement token refresh logic
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
5. Add unit tests for the API client and hooks

#### Environment Variables Needed:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
# Other WorkOS variables should be set on the backend
```

#### Dependencies Added:
- None (using existing `fetch` API)

#### Testing Instructions:
1. Start the Next.js development server
2. Navigate to `/login`
3. Click "Sign in with WorkOS"
4. Verify redirection to WorkOS login
5. After successful login, verify redirection back to the app
6. Check console for any errors

#### Known Issues:
- Backend API endpoints not yet implemented
- Session management needs to be implemented
- Error handling could be more comprehensive
- Need to handle token refresh

#### Notes:
- The implementation follows functional programming principles
- All API calls are centralized in the ApiClient
- Error handling is consistent across the application
- The code is fully typed with TypeScript
- The implementation is modular and follows the single responsibility principle
