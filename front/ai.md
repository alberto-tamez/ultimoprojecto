### Task: Fix Sign-Out Redirect to Localhost
-   **Change 1**: Modified `components/auth/sign-out-button.tsx`.
    -   **Reason**: The sign-out button was redirecting to `localhost:3000/signed-out` instead of the URL specified by `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` after the logout process. This occurred even though the server-side logout API seemed correctly configured.
    -   **Modification**: Updated the `handleSignOut` function to explicitly read `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`. Constructed the target signed-out URL (e.g., `http://<app_url>/signed-out`) using this environment variable. After the `fetch` call to `/api/auth/logout` completes, the client now explicitly navigates to this correctly constructed URL if not already there. This ensures the redirect destination uses the proper domain/host from the environment configuration, overriding any potentially incorrect URL (like `localhost`) that might have come from `response.url` in the `fetch` chain. Added a console warning if `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is not set.
    -   **Impact**: The sign-out flow now correctly redirects users to the `/signed-out` page on the domain specified by `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, resolving the issue of being redirected to `localhost`.

-   **Change 2**: Modified `components/dashboard.tsx`.
    -   **Reason**: User requested removal of the sign-out button from the dashboard component.
    -   **Modification**: Removed the import statement for `SignOutButton` and deleted the `<SignOutButton />` component instance from the JSX within the `CardTitle` of the main dashboard card.
    -   **Impact**: The sign-out button is no longer visible or accessible directly from the main data analysis dashboard component.

-   **Change 3**: Replaced content of `app/page.tsx`.
    -   **Reason**: Previous edit to integrate the `Navigation` component resulted in JSX errors. This change corrects the implementation.
    -   **Modification**:
        - Replaced the entire file content with a corrected version.
        - Imported `useState`, `signOut`, `useAuth`, `User` type, `Navigation`, and `Dashboard`.
        - Defined `MainPage` component with `currentPage` state management (`useState`).
        - Implemented `handleSignOut` and `handlePageChange` functions.
        - Added robust handling for `loading` and `!user` states.
        - Created a `NavigationUser` type and transformed the `user` object from `useAuth` to match the props expected by the `Navigation` component, providing defaults for potentially nullable fields (like `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `role`).
        - Rendered the `<Navigation />` component, passing `currentPage`, `onPageChange`, `onLogout`, and the transformed `navigationUser`.
        - Conditionally rendered `<Dashboard />` or a profile placeholder (which now also displays some basic user info) within a single `<main>` HTML5 element based on `currentPage`.
        - Removed unused `useRouter` import.
    -   **Impact**: The main page (`/`) now correctly displays the `Navigation` bar and conditionally renders the `Dashboard` or a profile placeholder. JSX errors are resolved. The `user` object passed to `Navigation` is now more type-safe and handles potential null/undefined values from the WorkOS user object. The page structure is cleaner.

-   **Change 4**: Removed `User` type import in `app/page.tsx`.
    -   **Reason**: Persistent TypeScript errors (`Module '"@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs"' has no exported member 'User'.`) indicated that the `User` type is not being exported as expected, despite attempts to import it from `@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs/components` and then `@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs`.
    -   **Modification**:
        - Removed the line `import type { User } from '@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs';`.
        - The `user` object obtained from the `useAuth()` hook will now have its type inferred by TypeScript.
        - The locally defined `NavigationUser` interface will continue to provide type safety for the props passed to the `Navigation` component.
        - The existing logic for constructing `navigationUser` already handles potentially nullish properties from the `user` object.
    -   **Impact**: The TypeScript error related to the `User` type import is resolved. The code now relies on type inference for the `user` object from `useAuth` and the custom `NavigationUser` interface for component prop typing.
